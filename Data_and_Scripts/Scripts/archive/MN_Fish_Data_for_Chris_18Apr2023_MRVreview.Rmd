Load in required packages
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(data.table)
```



Read in raw MN Data
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load in gillnet and trapnet data

GN_TN <- read_csv("E:/Shared drives/Hansen Lab/RESEARCH PROJECTS/Fish Survey Data/MN_Data/mn_raw_disaggregated_data/mn_fish_effort_03May2022.csv")

#Load in shallow and deep gillnets, same kind of net, different gear code

GDE_GSH <- read_csv("E:/Shared drives/Hansen Lab/RESEARCH PROJECTS/Fish Survey Data/MN_Data/mn_raw_disaggregated_data/mn_gde_gsh_fish_effort_03May2022.csv")
```

Combine GN, TN, GDE, GSH into one df
```{r}
all_GN_TN <- bind_rows(GN_TN, GDE_GSH)

```

###################Problem (that might not actually be breaking anything): the survey IDs are garbage. ##########

```{r}
# create separate df of just surveys aka the survey effort
Effort_GN_TN <-  all_GN_TN %>%
  select( SURVEY_ID, SURVEYDATE, SURVEYTYPE, DOW, LKNAME, YEAR, GEAR, EFFORT)%>%
  group_by( SURVEY_ID, SURVEYDATE, SURVEYTYPE, DOW, LKNAME, YEAR, GEAR, EFFORT)%>%
  summarise(NUMBER_OF_SP = n())%>%
  select(-NUMBER_OF_SP)%>%
  # filter(SURVEYTYPE %in% c("Population Assessment", "Re-Survey", "Standard Survey", "Special Assessment", "Targeted Survey", "Large Lake Survey", "Research Survey", "Initial Survey"))%>% ########## if you want to exclude these from chris's data you have to do this operation below, too.

#diagnosing this: Hey Holly, I wanted to check in about a previous data discrepancy I messaged you about earlier hereâ€¦not the 10000 catfish, but the issue I saw where it seemed rows were somewhat duplicated (i.e., it seemed that if a fish had a TOTAL_CATCH > 0, there was a row for that TOTAL_CATCH > 0 and another row with all of the same information, including EFFORT, where TOTAL_CATCH = 0). Did you all come across that in your QAQC? If the issue was as simple as I thought it was I believe my workaround overcomes it but I was curious if you noticed it at all during your efforts
